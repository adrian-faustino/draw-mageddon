## Description
A 4-player multi-lobby web browser drawing game using web sockets to sync each unique game instance. Each player draws a quadrant of an image. At the end of each round the game puts together each section and animates how each player drew their section.

## Currently only supports Chrome and Firefox browser on the desktop.

This is a separate repo with all the changes I will make to make the app compatible across other platforms such a mobile, and also across multiple browsers. The original repo of the demo version which I created with Jason Melnikel for our Lighthouse Labs bootcamp final project can be found here: https://github.com/adrian-faustino/LHL-final-project
